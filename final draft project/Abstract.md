# Analyzing Stock Market Patterns Through Clustering and Correlation of Base-Level Data

## Abstract
This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of stock market behavior using base-level data such as daily prices, volume, and returns. By leveraging historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply clustering techniques to group stocks based on performance metrics like average returns and volatility. Through this approach, we explore how different stocks and sectors respond to market events, revealing relationships and dependencies that may not be immediately visible through individual stock analysis. By examining correlations and sector-based trends, we aim to track interdependencies within the market, uncovering patterns associated with volatility or sector-specific risks. These insights offer valuable perspectives for investors, analysts, and researchers, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions and develop robust risk management strategies. This project emphasizes simplicity and interpretability, making it a practical tool for those seeking to gain actionable insights from core stock data without relying on complex financial derivatives or advanced metrics like implied volatility or Greeks.
